/**
 * Table cards allow you to display tabular data in your response (for example,
 * sports standings, election results, and flights). You can define columns
 * and rows (up to 3 each) that Assistant shows in your table card. You can
 * also define additional columns and rows, along with their prioritization.
 *
 * @example
 * ```javascript
 * app.handle('Table', conv => {
 *   conv.add('This is a table.');
 *   conv.add(new Table({
 *     "title": "Table Title",
 *     "subtitle": "Table Subtitle",
 *     "image": new Image({
 *       url: 'https://developers.google.com/assistant/assistant_96.png',
 *       alt: 'Google Assistant logo'
 *     }),
 *     "columns": [{
 *       "header": "Column A"
 *     }, {
 *       "header": "Column B"
 *     }, {
 *       "header": "Column C"
 *     }],
 *     "rows": [{
 *       "cells": [{
 *         "text": "A1"
 *       }, {
 *         "text": "B1"
 *       }, {
 *         "text": "C1"
 *       }]
 *     }, {
 *       "cells": [{
 *         "text": "A2"
 *       }, {
 *         "text": "B2"
 *       }, {
 *         "text": "C2"
 *       }]
 *     }, {
 *       "cells": [{
 *         "text": "A3"
 *       }, {
 *         "text": "B3"
 *       }, {
