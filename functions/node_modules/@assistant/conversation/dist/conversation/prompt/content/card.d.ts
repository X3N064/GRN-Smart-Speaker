/**
 * Basic cards are designed to be concise, to present key (or summary)
 * information to users, and to allow users to learn more if you choose (using
 * a web link).
 *
 * Use basic cards mainly for display purposes, as they have no interaction
 * capabilities without a button. To link a button to the web, a surface must
 * also have the `WEB_LINK` capability.
 *
 * @example
 * ```javascript
 * app.handle('Card', conv => {
 *   conv.add('This is a card.');
 *   conv.add(new Card({
 *     "title": "Card Title",
 *     "subtitle": "Card Subtitle",
 *     "text": "Card Content",
 *     "image": new Image({
 *       url: 'https://developers.google.com/assistant/assistant_96.png',
 *       alt: 'Google Assistant logo'
 *     })
 *   }));
 * });
 * ```
