/**
 * Describes a sink used to export log entries to one of the following
 * destinations in any project: a Cloud Storage bucket, a BigQuery dataset, or a
 * Cloud Pub/Sub topic. A logs filter controls which log entries are exported.
 * The sink must be created within a project, organization, billing account, or
 * folder.
 *
 * @property {string} name
 *   Required. The client-assigned sink identifier, unique within the
 *   project. Example: `"my-syslog-errors-to-pubsub"`. Sink identifiers are
 *   limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters:
 *   upper and lower-case alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and
 *   periods. First character has to be alphanumeric.
 *
 * @property {string} destination
 *   Required. The export destination:
 *
 *       "storage.googleapis.com/[GCS_BUCKET]"
 *       "bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET]"
 *       "pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_ID]"
 *
 *   The sink's `writer_identity`, set when the sink is created, must
 *   have permission to write to the destination or else the log
 *   entries are not exported. For more information, see
 *   [Exporting Logs with Sinks](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs).
 *
 * @property {string} filter
 *   Optional. An [advanced logs filter](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries). The only
 *   exported log entries are those that are in the resource owning the sink and
 *   that match the filter. For example:
 *
 *       logName="projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]" AND severity>=ERROR
 *
 * @property {string} description
 *   Optional. A description of this sink.
 *   The maximum length of the description is 8000 characters.
 *
 * @property {boolean} disabled
 *   Optional. If set to True, then this sink is disabled and it does not
 *   export any log entries.
 *
 * @property {number} outputVersionFormat
 *   Deprecated. The log entry format to use for this sink's exported log
 *   entries. The v2 format is used by default and cannot be changed.
 *
 *   The number should be among the values of [VersionFormat]{@link google.logging.v2.VersionFormat}
 *
 * @property {string} writerIdentity
 *   Output only. An IAM identity&mdash;a service account or group&mdash;under
 *   which Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink's destination.
 *   This field is set by
 *   sinks.create
 *   and
 *   sinks.update
 *   based on the value of `unique_writer_identity` in those methods.
 *
 *   Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination, log entry
 *   exports from this sink will fail. For more information,
 *   see [Granting Access for a
 *   Resource](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_service_account_for_a_resource).
 *   Consult the destination service's documentation to determine the
 *   appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity.
 *
 * @property {boolean} includeChildren
 *   Optional. This field applies only to sinks owned by organizations and
 *   folders. If the field is false, the default, only the logs owned by the
 *   sink's parent resource are available for export. If the field is true, then
 *   logs from all the projects, folders, and billing accounts contained in the
 *   sink's parent resource are also available for export. Whether a particular
 *   log entry from the children is exported depends on the sink's filter
 *   expression. For example, if this field is true, then the filter
 *   `resource.type=gce_instance` would export all Compute Engine VM instance
 *   log entries from all projects in the sink's parent. To only export entries
 *   from certain child projects, filter on the project part of the log name:
 *
 *       logName:("projects/test-project1/" OR "projects/test-project2/") AND
 *       resource.type=gce_instance
 *
 * @property {Object} bigqueryOptions
 *   Optional. Options that affect sinks exporting data to BigQuery.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [BigQueryOptions]{@link google.logging.v2.BigQueryOptions}
 *
 * @property {Object} createTime
 *   Output only. The creation timestamp of the sink.
 *
 *   This field may not be present for older sinks.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Timestamp]{@link google.protobuf.Timestamp}
 *
 * @property {Object} updateTime
 *   Output only. The last update timestamp of the sink.
 *
 *   This field may not be present for older sinks.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Timestamp]{@link google.protobuf.Timestamp}
 *
 * @property {Object} startTime
 *   Do not use. This field is ignored.

 *   syslog_20170523. With partitioned tables the date suffix is no longer

 *   All new sinks will have this field set true and will use timestamp column
 *   based partitioning. If use_partitioned_tables is false, this value has no

 *
 *   See FieldMask for more information.

/**
 * Describes the customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) settings associated with
 * a project, folder, organization, billing account, or flexible resource.
 *
 * Note: CMEK for the Logs Router can currently only be configured for GCP
 * organizations. Once configured, it applies to all projects and folders in the
 * GCP organization.
 *
 * See [Enabling CMEK for Logs Router](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/routing/managed-encryption)
 * for more information.
 *
 * @property {string} name
 *   Output Only. The resource name of the CMEK settings.
 *
 * @property {string} kmsKeyName
 *   The resource name for the configured Cloud KMS key.
 *
 *   KMS key name format:
 *       "projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION]/keyRings/[KEYRING]/cryptoKeys/[KEY]"
 *
 *   For example:
 *       `"projects/my-project-id/locations/my-region/keyRings/key-ring-name/cryptoKeys/key-name"`
 *
 *
 *
 *   To enable CMEK for the Logs Router, set this field to a valid
 *   `kms_key_name` for which the associated service account has the required
 *   `roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter` role assigned for the key.
 *
 *   The Cloud KMS key used by the Log Router can be updated by changing the
 *   `kms_key_name` to a new valid key name. Encryption operations that are in
 *   progress will be completed with the key that was in use when they started.
 *   Decryption operations will be completed using the key that was used at the
 *   time of encryption unless access to that key has been revoked.
 *
 *   To disable CMEK for the Logs Router, set this field to an empty string.
 *
 *   See [Enabling CMEK for Logs
 *   Router](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/routing/managed-encryption) for more information.
 *
 * @property {string} serviceAccountId
 *   Output Only. The service account that will be used by the Logs Router to
 *   access your Cloud KMS key.
 *
 *   Before enabling CMEK for Logs Router, you must first assign the role
 *   `roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter` to the service account that
 *   the Logs Router will use to access your Cloud KMS key. Use
 *   GetCmekSettings to
 *   obtain the service account ID.
 *
 *   See [Enabling CMEK for Logs
 *   Router](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/routing/managed-encryption) for more information.
