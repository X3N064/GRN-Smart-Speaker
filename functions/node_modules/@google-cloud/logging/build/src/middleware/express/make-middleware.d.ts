/**
 * Generates an express middleware that installs a request-specific logger on
 * the `request` object. It optionally can do HttpRequest timing that can be
 * used for generating request logs. This can be used to integrate with logging
 * libraries such as winston and bunyan.
 *
 * @param projectId Generated traceIds will be associated with this project.
 * @param makeChildLogger A function that generates logger instances that will
 * be installed onto `req` as `req.log`. The logger should include the trace in
 * each log entry's metadata (associated with the LOGGING_TRACE_KEY property.
 * @param emitRequestLog Optional. A function that will emit a parent request
 * log. While some environments like GAE and GCF emit parent request logs
 * automatically, other environments do not. When provided this function will be
 * called with a populated `StackdriverHttpRequest` which can be emitted as
 * request log.
